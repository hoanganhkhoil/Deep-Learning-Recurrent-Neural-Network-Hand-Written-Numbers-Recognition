# Deep-Learning-Recurrent-Neural-Network-Hand-Written-Numbers-Recognition
A Deep Learning technique called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) written in Python to help recognizing hand-written numbers. The code utilize some Tensorflow built-in functions such as AdamOptimizer() (for the optimizer), softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits() (for cost function), and BasicLSTMCell() (for Long Short-Term Memory)
